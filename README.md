# Introduction 
The Skill-Matrix Project is a full-stack web application which helps companies and organizations measure their employees and/or members skills, and provide valuable information about them such as level of education, certificates etc.  The app basicly provides two types of role which are admin and user roles. As an Admin, users can define skills and their categories, disable or enable and delete a specific user profile and can see the statistics about skills and users. When it comes to ordinary users, they can create their profile and manage their skills and update their information.
